            <h1>Tools for Graphic Designing</h1>
            <br>
            <br>
            <ol>
                <li>Adobe Photoshop</li>
                <p>Adobe Photoshop has long remained the industry standard for desktop publishing. It is a popular favorite with graphic designers for a reason. Its array of image editing tools supports the beginner to the pro with a user-friendly interface and a plethora of well-written tutorials. The graphic design software puts you in control, from the canvas size to the artistic filter.</p>
                <li>Adobe Illustrator</li>
                <p>Adobe Illustrator wrote the book on vector graphics software. It sets the standard for professionally designed logos, artwork, infographics, icons, and much more. You can work from a freehand sketch to a vector image that is scalable to any size. Adobe Illustrator works with graphics differently, using mathematical formulas instead of pixels for seamless resizing.</p>
                <li>CorelDraw</li>
                <p>CorelDraw is a vector graphics editor developed and marketed by Corel Corporation. It is also the name of the Corel graphics suite, which includes the bitmap-image editor Corel Photo-Paint as well as other graphics-related programs.</p>
                <li>Procreate</li>
                <p>Procreate bills itself as a complete art studio, made exclusively for iPad and Apple Pencil support. It is a one-time purchase with no free trial or version available. You dive right into its vast array of templates, fonts, and customizable brushes. You can also bring your favorite Photoshop ones into the app, which will perform better with the Valkyrie engine. The developers went the extra mile to make it user-friendly.</p>
                <li>Affinity</li>
                <p>Affinity Photo is a value-priced alternative to Adobe Photoshop or Adobe Illustrator for touch-up jobs on existing images. It works with layers and filters to create stunning effects, with both vector and raster images. The software also supports the SVG file format like CorelDRAW. While you can create templates, none are included with the program. However, it is lightweight with a generous 90-day free trial.</p>
                <li>Canva</li>
                <p>Canva is an all-around solution for creating a variety of projects, such as infographics, web design, or T-shirts. It uses an intuitive drag-and-drop interface that is easy to use for individuals with no previous experience in graphic design. The program has a huge selection of images, templates, backgrounds, and fonts to get the ball rolling. While Canva offers a number of these items for free, many of the images and graphics require in-app purchases.</p>
                <li>Gravit Designer</li>
                <p>Gravit Designer is more than just an image editing software — it’s also a GNU image manipulation program and vector illustration software. The best part of Gravit Designer is how customizable and user-friendly it is, as its HTML-based program is compatible with most platforms. Gravit Designer includes 500 MB of cloud storage with the free plan and unlimited storage with the pro version</p>
                <li>Adobe InDesign</li>
                <p>Adobe InDesign is the company’s answer to a standalone desktop publishing program. While you can use it with other Adobe programs, it speaks a different language that some may find hard to use. It’s best suited for image-heavy posters, presentations, and documents. You can create a house style on the fly, making it an excellent timesaver.</p>
                <li>Pixlr</li>
                <p>Pixlr is an image editing web app you can use in your browser for desktop work or in mobile apps supported both in the iOS and Android platforms. It’s a basic program that is perfect if you need the essential editing tools covered without all the bells and whistles (and learning curves) of more sophisticated offerings.</p>
                <li>Figma</li>
                <p>Figma offers a lot of features for free graphic design software. One of the most impressive is the free unlimited cloud storage with the free version. Its strength is with vector graphics, with an impressive range of tools. You’ll have to pop for the professional plan to get invite-only private projects. Otherwise, you can share a link for collaboration.
                    Figma gives businesses a lot of latitude with customization, particularly at the organization level. You can create and administer private plugins. Comparatively speaking, it is an affordable plan.</p>
