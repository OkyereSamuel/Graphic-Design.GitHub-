            <li>You don’t have to be an expert</li>
            <p>I do not want to discredit professional graphic designers at all, so let me begin by saying if you want to work in the industry and get the very best training possible, go the traditional route, get a graphic design degree and become an expert.
                <br>If you are not wanting to go that traditional route and you just want to try your hand at graphic design – like if you want to design your own wedding invitations, or you want to start a small business selling clip art, or you’re helping your sister create a logo for her new blog – don’t let your amateur status stop you.
                <br>When I started designing stationery I literally had zero experience. I just learned as I went, playing around with different techniques, figuring things out along the way and faking it the whole time. You don’t have to be an expert.</p>
            <li>Start with the right program</li>
            <p>My experience with graphic design began with Microsoft Publisher – mainly because it was what I had. When that didn’t do all I needed, I moved on to a free design program which worked okay, but became frustrating when, again, I couldn’t do all I needed (like automatically centering items or undoing without having to completely start over).
                <br>I was super intimidated by Adobe Illustrator because it seemed like something way over my head, but little by little, I figured it out and believe me, it is a million times better than any other program I’ve tried. It’s robust, that’s for sure, but you don’t have to use all the functions to enjoy the benefits it offers.
                <br>Useful things like adding special characters (called glyphs) and spacing out letters (kerning), making clipping masks (think words or shapes cut out of a photo or background pattern) and picking colors are all simple to do with Illustrator. Start with the right program from the beginning and you’ll avoid all sorts of creative frustrations.</p>
            <li>There’s no need for a fancy computer</li>
            <p>You’ve probably heard it said that a Mac is best for creating graphics. This is true and I’m a big fan of all things Apple, but I didn’t start out with anything special.
                <br>In fact, the laptop I used when I first began designing sounded like the motor was about to take off after about an hour of use and it got so hot I had to keep it off my lap while working. Definitely nothing fancy.
                <br>There’s no need to go out an invest in a new computer, just make sure the one you have has enough memory to run Illustrator.</p>
            <li>And you don’t need any special gadgets either</li>
            <p>Several years ago, my Mom saw that I was loving this design stuff and he bought me a Wacom tablet and pen. It was so, so sweet and a really great tool for digital creating and yet, I’ve only used it twice.
                <br>Moral of the story is: don’t go out and buy the extras until you know you need them. Most of the time I design using my wireless mouse on my main computer, occasionally with the trackpad on my laptop and when I really need details, I’ll draw on paper first and scan it into Illustrator to turn into a vector graphic.</p>
            <li>You will get (so much) better with time</li>
            <p>As with most learned skills, practice makes a huge difference. As you learn new techniques and helpful short cuts you’ll get faster and more proficient and over time, you’ll really hone in on your style. It’s fun to see how your designs progress with time. You may cringe a little at your first work (I sure do!) but that’s all part of the learning curve.</p>
